# SVM Binary Classification - Breast Cancer Dataset

This project demonstrates:
- Loading and preprocessing a dataset.
- Training SVM with both linear and RBF kernels.
- Visualizing decision boundaries using 2D features.
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
- Model evaluation with classification report and cross-validation.

## Files
- `Task7.ipynb`: Main script.
- `breast-cancer.csv`: Dataset file (you must place it in the same folder).

## How to Run
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
python Task7.ipynb
```
